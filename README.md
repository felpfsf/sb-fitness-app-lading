# SB - Fitness App

A Landing page about a fictional Fitness App. It includes an about section, with description about the service, a section with the results of the SB Fitness Program, testimonials, contact section with form and an address card and map.

It's based on the original Figma's [SPORT](https://www.figma.com/file/jJ9O9nSrSkEBmuHkPFDFCY/SPORT-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1) design, it's in russian so I had to translate but I didn't had time to review it.
